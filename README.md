Discount Offers Challenge

In this challenge, I have created a program that takes a file path argument with each line in that file being a test case, and prints out the maximum combined ss score for each group of products and customers.  The program is run by typing the command "python run.py [data file path]".  The classes and functions executing the algorithm live in the file alrgorithm.py, to isolate them from the execution logic in run.py.  I also added test coverage for all functions, contained within the test.py file.  These can be run through the command "python -m unittest test".  There is a sample ascii data file, data.txt, that I included here for testing purposes which contains the three test cases from the provided prompt in instructions.md.

My general approach to solve the problem of finding the maximum ss score was to create a 2d array containing the ss scores for each customer product pairing, and then to feed that matrix into a recursive backtracking algorithm that is designed to investigate all possible valid and unique combinations of combined ss scores.  As the algorithm goes deeper down the recursive stack, the algorithm remembers which columns and rows were already blocked off by prior choices, ensuring only valid results.  When returning up the recursive stack, those columns and rows blocked for lower levels are freed up for use.  In this algorithm, a variable is used to remember the max score that has been encountered in each recursive call, and that max score from each level is ultimately returned.
